# Basic Array Sorting
This project implements four basic dynamic array sorting algorithms in **C++**.

Algorithms implemented  in *sorting.c*:
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Radix Sort

Makefile uses **Makefile** and **g++** as compiler. These packages should be installed into the system in order to run the project. *main.c* contains a simple demonstration and test for sorting algorithms. Inside of main can be changed as desired.

After navigating to the projects directory to compile the project execute
> make

After compiation, in order to run the project, run command below
> make run

You can see the resuts in the terminal.
