# Basic Array Sorting
This project implements four basic dynamic array sorting algorithms in **C++**.

Algorithms implemented  in *sorting.c*:
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Radix Sort

Makefile uses **g++** as compiler. It should be installed into the system in order to run the project. *main.c* contains a simple demonstration and test for sorting algorithms. Inside of main can be changed as desired.
